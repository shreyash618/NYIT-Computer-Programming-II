Title

Integration of Inheritance and Composition
Content

Implement the following class:

public class Department{

/* The basic feature of a department */
private String deptName;
private int numMajors;
private Teacher[] listTeachers; //inherits from Person class
private Student[] listStudents; //inherits from Person class

/* Construct a department object (at least TWO constructors) */

/* Accessors and mutators (one pair per each feature) */

    /* toString method */

}
Fill in the blanks above according to the guidelines in the comments. Also write a main method that will use one of constructors to create two Department objects. Your main method should print out the details of these two Departments (each department with at least 5 students and 3 teachers).
