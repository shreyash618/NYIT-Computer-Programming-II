Title

Work Out Fibonacci Numbers
Content

In this lab, please write a Java class with a recursive method which is able to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number (For more information regarding the Fibonacci number, please refer to the Wikipedia link hereLinks to an external site. ) . 

 

Note that the following rules apply when calculating the n-th Fibonacci number F(n):

F(0) = 0,   F(1) = 1,  and  F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for any n >=2

 

In addition, please write a main method that calculates and prints out the first 20 Fibonacci number (which should be F(0) through F(19)).
