Title

Build Your Own Upper/Lower Case Convertor
Content

Please follow the example on the lecture to develop a GUI program named “Upper/Lower Case Convertor”. Note that it is currently fine to implement this GUI program without the actual functionality. In other words, we will primarily practice on developing the front end UI for this lab. It is totally fine now if nothing happens when the buttons are clicked.
