Title

Measurement Unit Convertor
Content

Please design and develop a “Measurement Unit Convertor” application in Java, which can convert a numeric value from pound (lb) to kilogram (kg). Also you are expected to capture any exceptional situation (such as entering a String “abc” in the pound textField, etc.) using the exception handling technique we have covered in the previous lecture. 

An example of the GUI program is shown below for your reference.
