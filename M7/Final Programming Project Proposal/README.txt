M7: Final Programming Project Proposal
Due Apr 19, 2022 by 11:59pm Points 10 Submitting a file upload Attempts 2 Allowed Attempts 2
Instructions
In this programming project, you are expected to design and implement a Java GUI program of your own choice, which should contain at least TWO layers (such as a JFrame and a JPanel, etc.), and should use at least FOUR DIFFERENT TYPES of GUI components (such as JButton, JLabel, JTextArea, JTextField, etc.). You should work in a group of 2-3 students who are all in this class to complete this final programming project.


The goal of this programming project is to allow you to apply what we have learned so far and will learn soon from both CSCI 125 and CSCI 185 (just to name a few: data types, if-else, switch, loops, class/objects, inheritance, composition, exception handling, file I/O, Java GUI programming, recursion, etc.) to develop a more sophisticated and interactive Java program. For instance, if you allow user to enter some information from TextField/TextArea, then the exception handling mechanism will become necessary because your program will be expected to be able to respond to any possible user input. In addition, if you want to save a record of the information obtained from your front-end GUI program, then it may be necessary to integrate the File I/O to write the information to a file.

The first phase of this final programming project is to work out and submit a proposal. You should work with your teammates to identify one Java GUI program that you want to develop, such as a game, an app, etc. In the proposal, please clearly put the title and an abstract (200-300 words) to describe the overall idea of your GUI program.

Follow the steps below to submit your proposal for the final programming project.
