Title

Define a Class of Student
Content

Design a class named Student to represent a student. The class contains the following data fields: name (private, String), stu_id (private, String), GPA (private, double), and age (private, int). You should define the set/get methods for each field. Also define two constructors, one fully loaded constructor and one no-arg constructor.

In a separate class named StudentAccess, create a main method that instantiates three student objects using the above two constructors separately. In addition, you should show how to access and mutate the object data field by calling the access/mutator methods.
