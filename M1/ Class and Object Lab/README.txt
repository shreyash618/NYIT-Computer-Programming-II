Title

Define a Class of Rectangles
Content

Design a class named Rectangle to represent a rectangle. The class contains:

Two double data fields named width and height that specify the width and height of the rectangle. The default values are 1.0 for both width and height.
A no-arg constructor that creates a default rectangle
A constructor that creates a rectangle with a specified width and height
A method named getArea() that returns the area of a rectangle
A method named getPerimeter() that returns the perimeter
The main method in your program should do the following things:

Create the first rectangle using the no-arg constructor
Create a second rectangle using the constructor's arguments to set the width to 4.0 and the height to 40.0
Print out the area of the first rectangle
Print out the perimeter of the second rectangle
