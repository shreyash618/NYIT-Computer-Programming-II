Title

Define a Java Class Professor
Content

Design a Java class named Professor to represent a professor. The class contains the following data fields: name (private, String), department (private, String), annual_salary (private, double), and year_in_profession (private, int). You should define the set/get methods for each field. Also define two constructors, one fully loaded constructor and one copy constructor. Also define the toString method for it.

In a separate class named ProfessorAccess, create a main method that instantiates three professor objects using the above two constructors separately. In addition, you should show how to access and mutate the object data field by calling the access/mutator methods. Also use the toString method to print out the content of each professor object.
