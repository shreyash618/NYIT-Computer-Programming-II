Create Your Own Paint Program
Content

In this lab, you are expected to work in a team of 2-3 students and develop your own paint program. The basic version of the paint program should allow the user to select from several colors, such as red, blue, and green, and also erase the current paint work, or clear up the whole canvas.

*BONUS part 1* (1 points)

If you could add an additional button that allows the user to customize the width of the paint brush as well as eraser, you will be eligible for part 1 of  BONUS.

*BONUS part 2* (1 points)

If you can add an additional button that can save what you drew to an image file (such as jpg or gif, etc.) , you will be eligible for part 2 of the BONUS.

Enjoy programming!
