Title

Write Your Own Exception Classes
Content

In this lab, we aim at writing an exception class by ourselves which inherits from the generalized Exception class.

More specifically, you should define multiple exception classes, each of which can capture one of the at least three different exceptional cases for a bank account (such as deposit/withdraw negative amount, overdraft, opening the account with zero balance, etc.). So you should define at least three exception classes by yourself in this lab. Also define a bank account class with a main method, in which you will create a bank account example and demonstrate how your own exception class could help handle those different types of exceptions.
