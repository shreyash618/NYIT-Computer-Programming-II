Polymorphism
Content

In this lab, please use Java to define a base class Person and three derived classes Professor, Secretary, and Student_Worker. For each derived class, you should define an integer data field num_vacation and an integer data field salary. Then you should use polymorphism to determine what type of vacation and salary each type of employee will have, as shown in the diagram below.

For instance, you can define an overridden getPaid method which can show which type of pay the person is getting. Also you can define an overridden getVacation method which can determine what type of vacation a person is eligible.
