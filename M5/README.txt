Title

Abstract Class
Content

In this lab, please define ONE base abstract class Employee and two derived concrete classes Professor and TA. For the base class, you should define two abstract methods: getPay() and getDaysOff(), and also two concrete methods samePay() and sameDaysOff(). Then in the two concrete classes, you should fully implement the two abstract methods defined in the base abstract class.

Also, you should create a “driver” class to create several Professor and TA objects, and compare if they have the same pay or the same number of days off.

Please refer to the diagram below for the class hierarchy and details.
